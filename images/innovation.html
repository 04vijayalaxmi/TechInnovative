          <p>State of the art, the highest level of development, as of a device,<br> technique,
             or scientific field.Cutting-edge technology is important<br> because it introduces
              new solutions that can enhance human society.<br>
              As AI continues to gain popularity,ts use cases are expanding<br> 
              and evolving into new areas. But use cases aren’t 
              the only thing<br> that’s evolving. AI itself continues 
              to grow more advanced <br>every year. However, there’s a problem.
               Approximately 60%<br> of businesses cite a “shortage of data science 
               talent” as the<br> primary barrier to realizing their AI potential.
                That’s where<br> AI Superior comes in.

            purposes, from starting a company or helping it run<br>
             more efficiently to aiding its expansion. Grants <br>
             are not simply free money, however. The funds must<br>
              be used in accordance with the terms of the grant<br>
              , and if they are not, they will have to be paid <br>
              back—possibly with interest.
